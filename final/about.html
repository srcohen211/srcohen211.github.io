        For those missing their Sushi Deli and Japanese Market fix — both which closed in March 2017 after a 37 year run — can now get a taste of both at the newly opened Sushi Erika (1700 79th Street Causeway). Operated by the daughter of Sushi
        Deli’s owner Michio Kushi, Erika Kushi, it features a similar feel and menu as its predecessor.

        Located in a strip mall just up the street from the original Japanese Market, it showcases plenty of similar dishes the cult-favorite eatery once did along with new additions. Favorites like the sweet shrimp, macadamia and love rolls, along
        with well priced sashimi options return to the menu while newcomers like octopus salad also can be found.

        "LEGIT. Affordable quality cuts of sushi. Order the hand rolls! You can order nearly any roll in a hand roll. Their nori is some of the best I've come across in South Florida. Extremely fresh, served warm, with a delightful crisp. They have
        daily specials. They have over 20 rolls to choose from. They have various cuts of fish. Everything is incredibly fresh and reasonably priced.

        Sushi Erika is extremely popular among the locals. They are always packed at peak hours. Wait times for the food are a little longer. It's a little spot tucked in at the end of a strip plaza. Currently the plaza is under construction. There
        is plenty of parking.

        I tried their uni from Maine, salmon belly nigiri, spicy scallop handroll, hamachi handroll, and the Battera roll - "Osaka Style" boxed marinated mackerel sushi with special kombu seaweed. Everything was incredible. Highly recommend. Looking
        forward to many future visits."" -Derek D. of @boujeeboyeats on instagram.

        "I would like to just to start off I'm very well familiar with Japanese cuisine. My friend Courtney kept bugging me to check out this place for the longest. Finally I went and wow I take my hat off to Erika she really killed it! Truly a
        hidden gem." -Erick G
